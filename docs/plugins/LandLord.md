# Landlord
Landlord introduces a property management system. Players can spawn "renters" (villagers) into designated properties, evict them with a special item, and manage them using tools like the "Renter Remover Wand."

## Features
- Renter Spawn Egg – Spawn renters (villagers) in a designated property using a custom egg item.
- Property Range Check – Renters can only be spawned within the bounds of a specific property.
- Renter Remover Wand – Right-click a renter to evict them instantly.
- Anti-Damage – Renters are immune to player or environmental damage.
- Event Handling – Custom events for spawning and despawning renters.
## Commands
`/property` - Get the Property Wand
`/removerenter` - Get the Renter Remover Wand
`/managehouses` - Open the Deed Menu to manage properties
## Permissions

## How to Use
### Spawning Renters
Get the Renter Spawn Egg from your inventory via command or plugin feature.
Throw the egg inside a designated property to spawn a renter.
The renter is automatically linked to the property; a success message will confirm it.
### Removing Renters
Right-click a renter with the Renter Remover Wand.
You’ll receive confirmation when the renter has been evicted.
### Renter Protection
Renters are immune to damage, preventing accidental harm or griefing.
