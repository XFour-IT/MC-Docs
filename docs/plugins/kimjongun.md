# Kim Jong Un

## How it works
- A special Kim Jong Un 3 mob can spawn randomly in the world.
- When defeated, it drops **one random part** (missile part or launchpad part).
- Collect the parts to craft an **Assembled Missile** and **Assembled Launchpad**.

## Crafting the Parts
Use any crafting grid (shapeless):
- **Assembled Missile** = missile nose + missile body + missile engine
- **Assembled Launchpad** = launchpad base + launchpad control + launchpad support

## Launching a Missile
1. Hold the **Assembled Launchpad** and right-click a block to place it.
2. Hold the **Assembled Missile** and right-click the launchpad.
3. Enjoy the dramatic launch sequence.

## Tips
- Launchpads and missiles use Nova-managed item visuals.
- You need the `kimjongun3.use` permission to place and launch.
